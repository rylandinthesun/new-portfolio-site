      For over a decade, music and touring were my life. From playing stages
      across multiple countries to contributing to four full-length albums, I
      lived the musical dream, and I will always cherish those experiences.
      However, a desire to explore something new led me to pivot my career
      towards software development. Now, I'm proud to call myself a frontend
      engineer at <a

      web application for legal professionals.

      When I'm not coding, recoding music, or bouldering at the climbing gym,
      you'll likely find me at home in the company of my loving wife, Amanda,
      and our two crazy cat companions, Nico and Stanley. Together, we enjoy
      exploring the Pacific Northwest, sipping on a fresh cup of coffee, cooking
      up new recipes, and watching the latest binge-worthy series.
